-Do App

This To-Do App is a simple task management application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches tasks from a mock API and allows users to add, delete, mark, and filter tasks in real time.

Purpose

I built this project to help myself start with small tasks that will prepare me for future, more complex projects I want to complete. It serves as both a practical learning exercise and a productivity tool.

Features

Fetch tasks: Retrieves a list of 10 to-dos from the JSONPlaceholder API.
Add tasks: Users can add new tasks that instantly show on the list.
Delete tasks: Each task has a delete button to remove it from the list.
Mark as completed: Tasks can be marked with a checkbox to indicate completion.
Filter tasks: Users can filter tasks by "Completed" or "Not Completed".
Prerequisites

Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
Internet connection (to fetch from JSONPlaceholder)
